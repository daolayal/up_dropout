# up_dropout

Uplift modeling is an approach for estimating the incremental effect of an action or treatment at the individual level. This project implements the uplift modeling framework to maximize the effectiveness of retention efforts in higher education institutions i.e., improvement of academic performance by offering tutorials. The objective is to improve the design of retention programs by tailoring them to students who are more likely to be retained if targeted. Students who participated in the tutorials are considered the treatment group, otherwise, they are assigned to the nontreatment group.
